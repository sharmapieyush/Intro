#Question4

#A Library is a chunk of code that you can call from your own code, to help you do things more quickly/easily.
# For example, a Bitmap Processing library will provide facilities for loading and manipulating bitmap images, saving you having to write all that code for yourself.
# Typically a library will only offer one area of functionality (processing images or operating on zip files)

#An API (application programming interface) is a term meaning the functions/methods in a library that you can call to ask it to do things for you - the interface to the library.
